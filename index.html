                        Subhas Chandra Bose 23 January 1897 – 18 August 1945)[h] was an Indian nationalist whose defiant
                        patriotism has made him a hero in India,but whose attempts during World War II to rid
                        India of British rule with the help of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan has left a troubled
                        legacy.The honorific Netaji (Hindustani: "Respected Leader") was first applied to Bose
                        in Germany in early 1942—by the Indian soldiers of the Indische Legion and by the German and
                        Indian officials in the Special Bureau for India in Berlin. It is now used throughout India.
